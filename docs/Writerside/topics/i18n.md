# Internationalization

The toolbox package includes some helpers for locale dependent url generations.

## Locale dependent url generation

Consider a customer page that has two different pages; one in Norwegian and English. Both english and norwegian
has a News section that shows different news.

| Domain     | Route      | Name               |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| test.no    | `/nyheter` | `nb_NO.news.index` |
| test.co.uk | `/news`    | `en_GB.news.index` |

Given a similar url structure, the `LocaleDependentUrlGenerator` will allow you to write

```PHP
<a href="{{ route('news.index') }}>Text</a>
```

regardless of which site you are on, but will navigate to `/news` when on `test.co.uk` and `/nyheter` when on `test.no`.

### Usage

The middleware does require some setup in order for it to work just like the laravel one. You can adjust your
RouteServiceProvider
or use the LocaleDependentUrlGenerator trait that configures it, and then
running `registerLocaleDependentUrlGenerator()` function.

```PHP
<?php
use Netflex\Toolbox\Traits;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\UrlGenerator as UrlGeneratorContract;

class RouteServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
    use LocaleDependentUrlGenerator;
    
    public function register() {
       $this->registerLocaleDependentUrlGenerator();
    }
    
}
```
